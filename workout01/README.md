This homework assignment takes data sets about five players on the Golden State Warriors basketball team: Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Stephen Curry.

These data sets have been individually modified for clarity and are joined by a data dictionary for even more clarity. This can be found in the "data" folder. 

A summary of the data can be found in the "output" folder. 

All of the code where this has been done can be found in the "code" folder. 

The data for each individual player, as well as for the combined data, has been turned into graphic plot visualizations displayed over a basketball court for physical appeal. The graphics show all of the shots taken and indicate with different colors, as depicted in the actual graphs, whether or not the attempted shot from any particular (x,y) coordinate was successfully made or not. 

All of the graphical visualizations, along with the court image underlying the graphs, can be found in the "images" folder.

Finally, attempted two-pointer and three-pointer shots have been turned into appealing and informatinoal tables and analyzed in a 1000+ word report in the "report" file. This analysis does a low-level inquiry into the best and worst players and makes a unique argument about the complexity of how this information can be assessed to judge the players' skill and value.
