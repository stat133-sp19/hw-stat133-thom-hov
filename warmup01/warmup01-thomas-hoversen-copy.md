How to Make
===========

### Crisp Rosemary Flatbread

Ingredients:

-   1 3/4 cups (230 grams) unbleached all-purpose flour
-   1 tablespoon chopped rosemary plus 2 (6-inch) sprigs
-   1 teaspoon baking powder
-   3/4 teaspoon salt
-   1/2 cup (120 ml) water
-   1/3 cup (80 ml) olive oil plus more for brushing
-   Flaky sea salt such as Maldon

Special Kitchen Tools:

-   Whisk
-   Bowl
-   Oven
-   Basting Brush
-   Rolling Pin
-   Chef's Knife
-   Parchment Paper
-   Baking Sheet
-   Airtight Container

Steps:

1.  Preheat oven to 450°F with a heavy baking sheet on rack in middle.
2.  Stir together flour, chopped rosemary, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Make a well in center, then add water and oil and gradually stir into flour with a wooden spoon until a dough forms. Knead dough gently on a work surface 4 or 5 times.
3.  Divide dough into 3 pieces and roll out 1 piece (keep remaining pieces covered with plastic wrap) on a sheet of parchment paper into a 10-inch round (shape can be rustic; dough should be thin).
4.  Lightly brush top with additional oil and scatter small clusters of rosemary leaves on top, pressing in slightly. Sprinkle with sea salt. Slide round (still on parchment) onto preheated baking sheet and bake until pale golden and browned in spots, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer flatbread (discard parchment) to a rack to cool, then make 2 more rounds (1 at a time) on fresh parchment (do not oil or salt until just before baking). Break into pieces.

-   **Flatbread can be made 2 days ahead and cooled completely, then kept in an airtight container at room temperature.**

When Is It Great?

-   This dish is *absolutely perfect* to be paired with a yummy summer salad or any vegetable dish! It also makes a *perfect addition* to any Summer bash you plan on attending. May be bring some to this year's Labor Day Party!

[Variations](https://www.elephantasticvegan.com/crispy-sesame-flatbread/):

-   If you want to do things differently feel free to get creative! May be instead of rosemary you prefer other spices. It also goes great with dips and hummus! Whatever way you choose to prepare it remember one thing: don't be scared to get creative because the dish is flexible and delicious.

Euclidean Distance
==================

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean Distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them $\\overline{\\mathbf{(pq)}}$. In Cartesian Coordinates, if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:
$$\\textit{d}(\\textbf{p}, \\textbf{q}) = \\textit{d}(\\textbf{q}, \\textbf{p}) = \\sqrt{(q\_1 - p\_1)^2 + (q\_2 - p\_2)^2 + ... + (q\_n - p\_n)^2}$$
$$= \\sqrt{\\sum\_{i = 1}^ {n} (q\_\\textit{i} - p\_\\textit{i})^2.}$$
 The position of a point in Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:
$$||\\mathbf{p}||= \\sqrt{p\_1^2 + p\_2^2 + ... + p\_n^2} = \\sqrt{\\textbf{p} \\cdot\\textbf{p}},$$
 where the last expression involves the dot product.
